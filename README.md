My experience creating this game

So I started off with making it work in the console without looking at the requirements first which was a great mistake. I'm definitely not too happy with all my if else statements and it should be more efficient but I focused first and foremost on getting it done. I came to the realiziation that I still hadn't grasped all concepts necessary for this exercise regarding the DOM, events, getelementbyid and so forth so I took my time to check this out before moving on. To solidify my knowledge of these important concepts I'm going make work of these optional exercises I still have open in the Javascript exercises.
Was planning to do some extra work this weekend.

Further more I think I should lay out the groundwork first for future projects, make a step by step plan (Readme) before going berserk in my IDE. It's not the prettiest or most complex of games but I'm quite happy I created most things necessary and went through the struggle.
That's a great feeling! Still want to improve this game however.

Look forward to more of these projects and getting better at it, I'm not giving up. It's supposed to be hard. If it was easy, everyone would do it.
